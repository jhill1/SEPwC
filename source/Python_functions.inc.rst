Python functions 
--------------------
.. index::
  pair: function; python

Whenever you write some code you get tempted to copy and paste a block, change a variable, and have two nearly
identical blocks of code, bar one variable. Might be OK with a single repeat, but what if you then need to
do that 10 times, or 100 times, or a million times?

This is where functions come in. You can generalise a bit of code and package it up so you can call it
repeatedly. That might be within the same script; it might be part of many scripts.

Using a Python function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. index::
  single: python; len()

We've used a number of Python functions already. 

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   print("Hello")
   range(0,len(my_list),1)

The first thing to note is that a function is called with ``()`` parentheses. Sometimes it gives back 
a value (called "returning a value"), sometimes it does not. Sometimes there are things in between the
parentheses, sometimes not (these are called "arguments").

So using, or calling, a Python function is easy. Give the function name, open the brackets, add any arguments you need (separated by commas),
close your brackets, if you are expecting a number back, store it:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   return_value = function_name(arg1, arg2, arg3)

As we've seen already you can nest functions within other functions!

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   range(0,len(my_list),1)

.. index::
  single: python; range()

Here, we're calling the ``range`` function to go from ``0`` to the length of my_list (``len(my_list)``) in steps of 1. But ``len()`` is 
also a function. The return value of ``len(my_list)`` gets put in place of that bit of code. This is exactly equivalent of doing:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   length = len(my_list)
   range(0,length,1)

where we store the length in a variable, then use it.

.. admonition:: Practical exercise

   **Nested functions**

   Write a single line of code to print the length of a list (which has the variable name `my_list`)

.. admonition:: Solution
   :class: toggle

   .. code-block:: python
      :caption: |python|

      print(len(my_list))

   We call the `len()` function inside of the `print()` function.

Writing your own Python functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whilst it's all well and good to use functions, you will need to write them too. Python allows you to create your own functions

They follow this pattern:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|
   
   def function_name(arg1, arg2, arg3):

       # do what you need to do

       return 

The key thing are the keyword ``def`` followed by the name of your function and the arguments expected, then a ``:``. Next comes your
function body (indented; remember whitespace matters!). At the end of your function, use the ``return`` keyword (with a value if you want
to return something).

Rather than staying abstract, let's do something more concrete. Let's write a function to convert from Centigrade to Fahrenheit. 

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def toFahrenheit(Centigrade):

       F = 9.0/5.0*Centigrade + 32.0

       return F

This function takes a value (Centigrade) and converts it to Fahrenheit, returning that number. We would use it something like this:


.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def toFahrenheit(Centigrade):

       F = 9.0/5.0*Centigrade + 32.0

       return F

   water_freezing = toFahrenheit(0)
   print("Water freezes at " + str(toFahrenheit(0)) + " deg F")



Function arguments in Python
.............................
.. index::
  single: function; arguments (python)

A function can take any number of inputs via arguments. You can even specify an unknown number of arguments. This are either keyword arguments (``kwargs``) or generic arguments (``args``).

Above we used a keyword argument, which gave us the variable name inside the function. Here is an example where the function takes
two keyword arguments:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def print_greeting(greeting, name):

       print(greeting+", "+name+"!")

       return

   print_greeting("Hello", "Bryan")

You can see that by specifying two arguments in the function declaration we have access to those values inside the function.
What happens if the user supplies only a single argument, not two as we've asked? Try the code below:


.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def print_greeting(greeting, name):

       print(greeting+", "+name+"!")

       return

   print_greeting("Hello")

What error message did you get?

.. admonition:: Check your answer
   :class: toggle


   .. code-block:: python
     :caption: |cli| |python|
     
      TypeError     Traceback (most recent call last)
      Cell In [1], line 7
            3     print(greeting+", "+name+"!")
            5     return
      ----> 7 print_greeting("Hello")

      TypeError: print_greeting() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'
      

We can also write functions that have default values.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def print_greeting(name, greeting="Hello"):

       print(greeting+", "+name+"!")

       return

   print_greeting("Bryan")

When running this, we can give the ``name`` argument and we get a default ``greeting``. We could also set the ``greeting`` ourselves:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def print_greeting(name, greeting="Hello"):

       print(greeting+", "+name+"!")

       return

   print_greeting("Bryan", "Ey-up")

However, you may note I've switched the order of the arguments around. What happens if we didn't?

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def print_greeting(greeting="Hello", name):

       print(greeting+", "+name+"!")

       return

   print_greeting("Bryan")

.. admonition:: Check your answer
   :class: toggle


   .. code-block:: python
      :caption: |cli| |python|
      
      Cell In [5], line 1
        def print_greeting(greeting="Hello", name):
                       ^
      SyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument

Python tells us that we have a syntax error and to swap the arguments around.

I mentioned earlier that you could pass an arbitrary number of arguments into a python function. This isn't used very often, but you will see it
in a few places when using Python. Let's think about a function to add some numbers together:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def sum_numbers(x,y,z):
      print("sum:",x+y+z)

   sum_numbers(1,2,3)

This prints:

.. code-block:: bash

   sum: 6

What if we wanted to add 9 numbers together? Or 1 million? This is where ``*args`` comes in. ``*args`` gives us an argument list of any length:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def sum_numbers(*numbers):
      
      sum = 0
      for n in numbers:
         sum = sum + n

      print("sum:", sum)

   sum_numbers(1,2,3)

This gives us the same result as last time, but we can also do:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |python|

   def sum_numbers(*numbers):
      
      sum = 0
      for n in numbers:
         sum = sum + n

      print("sum:", sum)

   sum_numbers(1,2,3)
   sum_numbers(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1000)
   sum_numbers(5,7)

Inside the function, the argument is represented by a tuple. We can therefore iterate over this and write code accordingly. We can also force
keyword arguments using a similar approach called ``**kwargs``.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: |python|
    
    def intro(**data):
        print("\nData type of argument:",type(data))

        for key, value in data.items():
            print("{} is {}".format(key,value))

    intro(Firstname="Sita", Lastname="Sharma", Age=22, Phone=1234567890)
    intro(Firstname="John", Lastname="Wood", Email="johnwood@nomail.com", Country="Wakanda", Age=25, Phone=9876543210)

Note that the ``**kwargs`` requires a keyword (which can be anything) and a value (which can be anything). Inside the function this is presented as a dictionary.
