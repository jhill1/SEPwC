Sentiment Analysis
===================

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is a way of extracting feelings from large amounts of text. When 
we read text we can use our understanding of the words to derive an emotion from the text the
author is trying to convey. This can be characterised as *positive* or *negative* or even in
more nuanced emotions like *joy* or *anger*.

The pipeline in R
------------------

We can use R's `tidyverse`, along with `tidytext`, data structures to perform these kinds of analyses quite easily, 
building a pipeline, something like this:


The Sentiment lexicon is the key to this. The simpliest way to analyse text is to break it into tokens: words.
Obviously, this is a bit simplisitc, we could have a positive word "great", preceeded by a negative one "not",
which flips the entire meaning. However, the idea behind sentiment analysis is to analyse vast amounts of text, 
so these issues get lost as noise. It's something you need to be aware of though if you want to do
this on real data.

There are three `sentiment` databases, packaged into a R library, we can use for general-purpose analysis:

 - `AFINN` from `Finn Ã…rup Nielsen <http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010>`_
 - `bing` from `Bing Liu and collaborators <https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html>`_
 - `nrc` from `Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney <http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm>`_

All of these are based on unigrams; single words, and are in English only. The `nrc` classifies
words in a binary fashion (i.e. yes/no) into categorieis of poisitve, negative, anger, joy, sadness, etc.
The `bing` lexicon categorises words into positive or negative. The `AFINN` lexicon creates a score between
-5 and 5 to show the sentiment (on a negative to positive scale). 

.. note::

  Each lexicon has a licence. You'll need to agree to the licence before using it. You will
  need to check if that licence is OK with your project. See :ref:`Software licences`.

Let's get these lexicons and see what they contain.

.. code-block:: R

    library(tidytext)

    get_sentiments("afinn")

    get_sentiments("bing")

    get_sentiments("nrc")

Each one is a table of words (the unigram) and the sentiment, either as an emotion, positive/negative, or a score.
